Topics include hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, multiple linear regression, limited dependent variable models, technical efficiency analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM). Emphasis will be placed on data-driven decision-making, model interpretation, and real-world applications in economic research.\n\n\nCourse objectives\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nPerform statistical hypothesis testing using tests on means to analyze economic data.\nAssess relationships between variables using correlation and multiple regression analysis.\nApply limited dependent variable models such as Logit, Probit, and Tobit in economic research.\nMeasure technical efficiency using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA).\nExtract and interpret latent variables using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA).\nDevelop measurement models through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA).\nConstruct and estimate structural equation models using both Covariance-Based SEM (CB-SEM) and Partial Least Squares SEM (PLS-SEM).\nImplement econometric techniques in R, ensuring reproducibility and proper visualization of results.\n\n\n\nCourse outline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nTopics\nLessons\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2-4\nModule 1: survey research design\n\nMethods of data collection\nSampling design in surveys\nMeasurement issues in survey research\nQuestionnaire construction\nBasics of interviewing\nCreating a codebook\nData entry\n\n\nDiscuss the various methods of data collection including survey, observation and experimental methods.\nDiscuss different ways for gathering a sample; random and non-random sampling.
